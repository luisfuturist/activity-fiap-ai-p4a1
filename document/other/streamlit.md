## Observations

Despite the outlined plans for system enhancements, some tasks remain unimplemented. These include adding visual graphs to display soil moisture variation and nutrient levels, as well as charts to present historical data for better trend analysis. The CRUD functionalities for managing areas—encompassing CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE operations—have not been developed fully, leaving area management incomplete. Additionally, the system lacks the capability to display insights generated by the Machine Learning model, which limits its utility in data-driven decision-making.
