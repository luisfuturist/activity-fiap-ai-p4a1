# TODO - FIAP Phase 4 Cap 1 - Automation and Intelligence in FarmTech Solutions

## Objective

Develop an enhanced FarmTech solution by integrating predictive intelligence and real-time monitoring to optimize irrigation and nutrient management. Leverage Scikit-learn for predictive modeling, Streamlit for visualization, and ESP32 for field hardware integration.

## Tasks

- **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Fork the repository from Phase 3.
  - [ ] Rename the repository to **PHASE 4** and align it with tutor Lucas's GitHub template (if required).
  - [ ] Review the base code to begin improvements.

- **Intelligence with Scikit-learn**
  - [ ] Develop a predictive model using Scikit-learn.
    - [ ] Base the model on historical moisture and nutrient data.
    - [ ] Generate predictions to suggest irrigation actions at specific times.
  - [ ] Integrate the model into the main system.

- **Interface with Streamlit**
  - [ ] Create an interactive interface for real-time data visualization.
    - [ ] Add graphs showing soil moisture variation and nutrient levels.
    - [ ] Display insights generated by the Machine Learning model.

- **LCD Display on Wokwi**
  - [ ] Configure and connect an LCD display to the ESP32 using the I2C bus (SDA and SCL pins).
  - [ ] Program real-time display of:
    - [ ] Soil moisture.
    - [ ] Nutrient levels.
    - [ ] Irrigation status.
  - [ ] Test functionality in the Wokwi environment.

- **Monitoring with Serial Plotter**
  - [ ] Implement Serial Plotter usage to monitor variables like:
    - [ ] Soil moisture.
  - [ ] Set up real-time graphs in the Serial Plotter.
  - [ ] Capture Serial Plotter screenshots for project documentation.

- **Memory Optimization on ESP32**
  - [ ] Review variable usage in the C/C++ code.
  - [ ] Apply optimizations to:
    - [ ] Integer, float, and char data types.
  - [ ] Comment on changes made, justifying memory-saving choices.
  - [ ] Test the impact of optimizations on system performance.

- **Database**
  - [ ] Review the FarmTech Solutions data model.
  - [ ] Update and enhance the database based on new functionalities.

- **Integration and Demonstration**
  - [ ] Update the repository README with:
    - [ ] Detailed descriptions of implemented improvements.
    - [ ] Screenshots of the Streamlit interface, Serial Plotter, and Wokwi LCD display.
  - [ ] Demonstrate Serial Plotter usage in the README with screenshot explanations.
  - [ ] Record a video (max. 5 minutes) demonstrating:
    - [ ] The updated system's functionality.
    - [ ] Upload the video to YouTube (unlisted mode).
    - [ ] Add the video link to the README.

### Deliverables
- [ ] Optimized C/C++ code for ESP32.
- [ ] Python code with Scikit-learn and Streamlit integration.
- [ ] Screenshots and detailed documentation in the README.
- [ ] Demonstrative video published and linked in the GitHub repository.
